# Vancouver Shop Local

This is a list of businesses/artists/crafters in the Greater Vancouver Area. It's designed to help you check out some stores during the holiday season and shop locally instead of big box stores. There is a Reddit thread, which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/qfxtlw/rvancouver_shop_local_holiday_guide_2021/).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
